# 📁 Project Summary: ScaffoldNewProjectandCommit

**Last Updated:** 2025-06-12

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 🔧 Scaffold Tool Setup
- Created and configured `create_project_universal.py` for multi-type project scaffolding.
- Supports project types like: `python_tool`, `shortcuts`, `raspberry_pi`, `automation_workflow`, `books`, `writing_project`, `wordpress_site`, `financial_tool`, `diy_product`, `video_project`.
- Sets up folders based on type (e.g. `icons`, `docs`, `csv_exports`, `chapters`, etc.).
- Creates `.gitignore`, `.env`, `README.md`, and initializes Git.
- Prompts for GitHub username, token, and project root path (remembered after first entry).
- Offers to set up `venv` automatically if selected.

### 💡 Custom Launcher Command Logic
- `launch_dev.command` and `end_dev.command` are saved inside each project’s `launchers/` folder.
- After creation, the script asks whether to `sudo cp` to `/Applications/Utilities/CustomLaunchers/{ProjectName}` and makes sure `chmod +x` is applied.

### 🧰 Scaffolder-Specific Launchers
- Custom `scaffold.command` and `end_scaffold.command` created.
- Only placed in: `/Applications/Utilities/CustomLaunchers/General Tools/` and in the project folder: `/Users/catmaru/Projects/ScaffoldNewProjectandCommit/`.

### 🔐 Security & Permissions
- `.env` file is created and configured manually.
- Permissions set so it’s not world-readable (recommended).
- `chmod` and `sudo cp` confirmed working.
- Confirmed correct behavior for `find` + `chmod`:
  ```bash
  sudo chmod +x /Applications/Utilities/CustomLaunchers
  sudo find /Applications/Utilities/CustomLaunchers -name "*.command" -exec chmod +x {} \;
  ```

### ✅ Git Integration
- Scaffolder supports both new repo creation and skips setup for existing project folders.
- `end_dev.command` and `end_scaffold.command` auto-commit changes to Git.
- Renamed commands for clarity.

## 🛠️ Outstanding / Future Improvements

- [ ] Improve `.env` prompting to allow editing or re-population (optional).
- [ ] Add `.template` README logic and auto-fill stubs based on project type.
- [ ] Optionally log success/failure of `sudo cp` and `chmod` into a log file.
- [ ] Add testing command or health check for verifying new project after scaffolded.
- [ ] Add ability to regenerate launchers if deleted.

## 🔁 Commands to Remember

```bash
# Re-run scaffolder
/Users/catmaru/Projects/ScaffoldNewProjectandCommit/scaffold.command

# Update launcher permissions
sudo chmod +x /Applications/Utilities/CustomLaunchers
sudo find /Applications/Utilities/CustomLaunchers -name "*.command" -exec chmod +x {} \;

# Edit .env securely
nano /Users/catmaru/Projects/{ProjectName}/.env
chmod 600 /Users/catmaru/Projects/{ProjectName}/.env
```

## 🧭 Suggested Next Steps

- [ ] Verify `README.md` templates per project type.
- [ ] Back up `.env` structure examples securely.
- [ ] Finalize launcher naming conventions in script.
- [ ] Consider logging project creation details per run.
